# Flywheel Tutorials/Import-Export Utilities

This folder is dedicated to using Flywheel's SDK to facilitate the import and export of datasets to and from Flywheel. Importing structured data into Flywheel ensures a consistent, reliable, and searchable dataset to share with collaborators. Exporting data in a preferred structure facilitates rapid representation of research data in a structure most effective for the task at hand (e.g. Machine Learning).

## Data Use Agreements

Many of these tutorials connect to public datasets that require a Data Use Agreement before downloading.  Please respect these constraints, as well as others, when uploading any data to a Flywheel instance.

## Imports

The following ipython Jupyter notebooks import public datasets into a specified Flywheel instance. Ensure you have the proper permissions in your Flywheel instance before attempting.

### [Kaggle Pneumonia Chest X-Ray](kaggle_pneumonia_chestxray.ipynb)

Import data from the [Kaggle RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/).

### [COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Dataset](covid_chestxray_dataset.ipynb)

Import data from the [COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset).
