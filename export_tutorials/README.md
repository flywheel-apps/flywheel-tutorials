# Flywheel Tutorials/Export Utilities

This folder is dedicated to using Flywheel's SDK to facilitate the export of datasets from Flywheel. Exporting data into a preferred structure and metadata facilitates rapid representation of research data for the task at hand (e.g. Machine Learning).

## Data Use Agreements

Many of these tutorials connect to public datasets that require a Data Use Agreement before downloading.  Please respect these constraints, as well as others, when uploading any data to a Flywheel instance.
