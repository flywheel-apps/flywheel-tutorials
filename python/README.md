# This folder hosts tutorials for python

It hosts a few notebooks that illustrate interactions with a Flywheel instance using the 
[flywheel-sdk](https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/product/backend/sdk/branches/master/python/index.html).

## Getting started

Notebooks are files that allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, 
visualizations and narrative text. They run in an open-source web applications such [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) 
or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org). 


### Requirements

* Access to a Flywheel instance.
* A Flywheel API key. More on how to get yours [here](https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/product/backend/sdk/branches/master/python/getting_started.html#api-key).

### Using mybinder.org or google collab (easiest, no installation required)  

[Mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) turns a git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks. 
Nothing to do. Just click [here to get started](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/flywheel-io%2Fpublic%2Fflywheel-tutorials/master?filepath=python%2FTOC.ipynb). 

If you have a google account you can also use google collab.  
Nothing to do. Just click [here to get started](https://colab.research.google.com/github/flywheel-apps/flywheel-tutorials/blob/master/python/TOC.ipynb). 

### Using your own Jupyter instance

* Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org).
* Git clone this repo: `git clone https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/public/jupyter-notebooks.git`.
* Start your jupyter instance and `cd` to the cloned repository to open one of the notebooks.
