# Python Tutorials

This repository contains [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks that illustrate interactions with a Flywheel instance using the [Flywheel](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us) [SDK](https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/product/backend/sdk/branches/master/python/index.html).

## Getting started

Notebooks are files that allow you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, 
visualizations, and narrative text. They run in an open-source web applications such [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org).

### Requirements

* Access to a Flywheel instance.
* A Flywheel API key. More on how to get yours [here](https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/product/backend/sdk/branches/master/python/getting_started.html#api-key).

### Immediate viewing (i.e., no installation required)

Using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) turns a Git repository into a collection of interactive notebooks. Just click [here to get started](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/flywheel-io%2Fpublic%2Fflywheel-tutorials/master?filepath=python%2FTOC.ipynb).

If you have a Google account you can also use Google Colab. Just click [here to get started](https://colab.research.google.com/github/flywheel-apps/flywheel-tutorials/blob/master/python/TOC.ipynb). 

### Using your own Jupyter instance

* Install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org).
* Git clone this repo: `git clone https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/public/jupyter-notebooks.git`.
* Start your Jupyter instance and `cd` to the cloned repository to open one of the notebooks.
