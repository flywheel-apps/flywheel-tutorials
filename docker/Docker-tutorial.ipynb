    "# Docker for Flywheel\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a program that allows you to create \"standard units of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.\"  In other words, you set up a self contained environment with any OS, any specific software you want at any specific version, and any other custom settings you may wish to include, and Docker packages all these settings into something called an \"image\".  You can then run this image identically on any machine that also has Docker. When an image is run, it creates a self-contained environment called a “container”. The image is basically a piece of software stored on your computer, while the container is the object that’s created when you run that software.  No more worrying about versions, dependencies and operating systems!  In a way, you can think of this as a super lightweight virtual machine that can run on any computer that also has Docker.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that our gears will run anywhere, we use Docker to create images, which we then run our gears on.  Each gear may have a custom Docker image, depending on the system or software requirements of that gear. As a developer, you will choose and specify exactly what kind of docker image you want to run your gear on.  That will be covered later in this tutorial.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we only need to install Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker comes in two flavors: Community Edition (CE)  and Enterprise Edition (EE). EE is a paid version of Docker, and it has more support provided from Docker themselves.   CE is a free docker engine, but don’t worry, they can do exactly the same things. Unless your lab is going to get a professional EE docker account, download the CE edition. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verify your computer meets Docker's system requirements. See Docker's documentation:\n",
    "    * [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/#what-to-know-before-you-install)\n",
    "    * [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/#install-docker-engine---community)\n",
    "    * [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#system-requirements)\n",
    "2. Follow Docker's instructions for creating an account and installing the app:\n",
    "    1. [Create a Docker account and sign in](https://hub.docker.com/signup)\n",
    "    2. Install Docker:\n",
    "        * [Mac](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac)\n",
    "        * [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)\n",
    "        * [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#install-docker-desktop-on-windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How do I know I did this step correctly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a new terminal window and type docker.  A long list of usage options should appear on your screen, starting with:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Usage: docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND\n",
    "A self-sufficient runtime for containers\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Logging in to docker\n",
    "Before you can fully utilize docker, and docker hub (essentially a repository for any docker images you make, so they can be accessed anywhere from any computer), you must first create a docker hub account.  To do this, visit dockerhub, and clicking \"Sign up for dockerhub\".  This will prompt you to generate a username and password.  Your username will be associated with all your docker images, so pick something easy to spell and remember.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've generated your account, open a terminal on your machine and link your account to docker by typing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker login`\n",
    " You will then be prompted for your docker username and your docker password.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once login is successful, you'll be able to push repos to your docker hub account, which will be discussed later in this tutorial.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started with Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pulling and running images\n",
    "To start, lets pull and run an image so we can play around with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker pull python:buster`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will download the latest python image from docker with a base OS of debian buster.  We can then run the image to get the python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "> docker run -it python:buster                              \n",
    "Python 3.8.5 (default, Jul 22 2020, 12:28:11) \n",
    "[GCC 8.3.0] on linux\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells docker to run the image `python:buster`, it also tells docker to run it interactively (-i), and to allocate a pseudo-TTY (-t).  The meaning of these flags are not important, just know that you need to supply `-it` whenever you want to run an image interactively, without it the image runs and exits normally without any interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also run a manual command using this format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "docker run -it python:buster /bin/bash               \n",
    "root@8a9607e0e927:/# python\n",
    "Python 3.8.5 (default, Jul 22 2020, 12:28:11) \n",
    "[GCC 8.3.0] on linux\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>> \n",
    "```\n",
    "We are again running the python:buster image interactively, but now we run the command `/bin/bash` which gives us an interactive bash shell.  We can then run python from this bash shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images can be searched for on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a docker image\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways of creating a docker image, using a Dockerfile, or pulling an existing image, and modifying it with `docker commit`.  A Dockerfile provides a list of instructions to run in order to create an image, which is usually more portable and reproducible than a modified image.  At Flywheel, we exclusively publish images built using a Dockerfile, however modifying images can be helpful for debugging creating a docker image, so I will go over both methods here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dockerfile\n",
    "So what is a Dockerfile.  Let's create a basic Dockerfile to run a python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Dockerfile\n",
    "# Start with python on debian as base\n",
    "FROM python:buster           \n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the environmental variable FLYWHEEL and change to that directory\n",
    "ENV FLYWHEEL /flywheel/v0      \n",
    "WORKDIR ${FLYWHEEL}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy the run.py script into the container\n",
    "COPY run.py ${FLYWHEEL}/run.py\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make the run.py script executable\n",
    "RUN chmod a+x ${FLYWHEEL}/run.py\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the entrypoint to be the run.py script\n",
    "ENTRYPOINT [\"/flywheel/v0/run.py\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then lets make a simple python script `run.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python\n",
    "print(\"Hello, World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our directory should look like the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    ".\n",
    "├── Dockerfile\n",
    "└── run.py\n",
    "\n",
    "0 directories, 2 files\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From within this directory, lets build the image and tag it with `[your_username]/hello_world:0.0.1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "> docker build -t flywheel/hello_world:0.0.1 ./ # build current directory ('./') and apply tag\n",
    "\n",
    "Sending build context to Docker daemon  13.82kB\n",

    "```\n",

    "Hello, World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Adding to the image\n",
    "Let's say that we need to install a specific python package such as numpy. We will test installing the package interactively, and then once we get it to work, we'll add it to the Dockerfile and rebuild:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " docker run -it python:buster /bin/bash\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "It looks like this command works as expected in the `python:buster` image, but it is always a good idea to check in the image before adding it to the Dockerfile.  Adding this line to the Dockerfile, we get:\n",

    "In this example, it takes such a short time to build the image, that we probably don't need to test the `pip` command in the image first, but in larger images where many things need to be installed and the building takes a significant amount of time, it is really helpful to test each command before you put it in the Dockerfile.\n",
